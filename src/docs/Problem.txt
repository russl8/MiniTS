=====
- Input is a test file specifying a single class (with a name):
	+ Content of the class is enclosed with a pair of curly brackets ({...}).
	+ There is an "attributes" section, where each attribute has: 
		* a name 
		* a type (INT only)
		* The name and type are separated by a colon (:).
	+ There is an "operations" section, where each operation has:
		* a name (e.g., fun1, fun2)
		* no parameters
		* a series of variable assignments (wrapped within a do ... end block).
		* The left-hand side (LHS) of each variable assignment is a single variable reference.
		* The right-hand side (RHS) of each variable assignment may be:
			- an integer literal (e.g., 23)
			- the reference of a variable (e.g., a1)
			- a compound expression (e.g., a1 * 2)
			  (Assume that only addition and multiplication are possible in the input.)
=====
- Output:
	+ Report an error if the LHS or RHS of a variable assignment references an undeclared attribute.
	  (You need not worry other kinds of semantic error such as duplicated operation names.)
	+ When multiple errors are present, report them all.
	+ If no errors are found:
		* Summarize the numbers of declared attributes and functions in the class.
		* For each operation:
			- Identify variables that are modified (ones appearing on the LHS).
			- Report the LAST value of each modified variable.
=====
- Develop Your Solution
	+ (Re-Generate) skeleton code via the ANTLR4 tool into the `antlr` package. 
	+ All Java classes you develop should go to the `model` package.
=====
- Example Tests:
	+ See t1 to t4 in the `tests` folder.
	+ Test your project via the command line (by exporting the project as a Runnable JAR file).
	+ Create additional test files that can be derived from the above input-output specification.
